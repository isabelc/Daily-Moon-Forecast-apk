Daily Moon Forecast android app
===============================

This is an android app that gives the current moon sign along with a forecast based on that zodiac sign. It updates automatically every 2 minutes. It uses the Swiss Ephemeris for Moon positions.

This is actually a web app, which uses Android's web view activity.

This must be compiled into an .apk with a program such as Eclipse.
